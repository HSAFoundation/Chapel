Chapel HSA: Examples Demonstrating HSA Support for Chapel
=========================================================

This directory contains a few simple example codes to show how execution
can be offloaded to a GPU using the hierarchical hsa locale.
The CHPL_LOCALE_MODEL should be set to 'hsa'.

Example programs:

     hello-sublocale.chpl   : a program to say hello from the hsa sublocales
     array-reduce.chpl      : a program for gpu-offload of 1D-array reduction

---------------------
Building the examples
---------------------

Most of the examples can be compiled without explicitly listing any
additional source files.  For example, the canonical "Hello, world!"
program can be compiled as follows:

     chpl -o hello hello-sublocale.chpl
