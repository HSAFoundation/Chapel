bug: domain query fields cause internal errors

When using the domain query syntax in an array field, the compiler
currently generates an internal error.  I don't believe that we ever
intended to support domain queries in the field context, so this
future is intended to change the internal error into a user-facing
error (where the message in the .good file is negotiable).  A sibling
future (domainQueryField-feature.chpl) asks the question whether we
ought to support the syntax in this context.
