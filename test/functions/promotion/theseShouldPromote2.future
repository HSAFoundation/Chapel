feature request: 'these' should enable promotion

This future asks the question as to whether a serial 'these' should be
sufficient to enable promotion or whether a parallel 'these' operator
should be required.  See issue #5114 for details.

In any case, the current error message suggests that something needs
to be fixed in the compiler.
